            <h2>The NBA Before LeBron's Era</h2>
            <p>Before LeBron entered the league, the NBA had a different landscape. The late 80s and 90s were dominated by legends such as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Hakeem Olajuwon. The style of play was more physical, with a heavy emphasis on defense and half-court play. Players in this era were known for their toughness, and teams focused on controlling the pace of the game, often resulting in lower-scoring contests.</p>
            <p>The 90s also featured many iconic rivalries and battles that shaped the culture of basketball. The league was in a transitional phase as the torch was being passed from the likes of Michael Jordan to a new generation of players, which included rising stars like Allen Iverson, Shaquille O'Neal, and eventually LeBron James. LeBron's arrival marked a new chapter in NBA history, bringing about a new level of athleticism and redefining the role of a forward in the modern game.</p>
