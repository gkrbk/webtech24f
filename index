        <h2 id="abgeorge">About George</h2>
        <p> 
            Hello! My name is George Kang-Rosenthal, and I’m currently a senior at <a href="https://www.babson.edu/" target="_blank">Babson College</a>, where I’ve been deeply engaged in the dynamic intersection of business and technology. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, I’ve always been surrounded by a vibrant culture that has significantly shaped my perspectives and ambitions. At 22 years old, I’m nearing the end of my undergraduate journey and eagerly anticipating the next chapter in my life. I’m passionate about both technology and business, and I plan to pursue a career that allows me to blend these interests seamlessly. My goal is to secure a remote job in the technology field, where I can contribute to innovative projects while maintaining the flexibility that remote work offers. At the same time, I have a strong entrepreneurial drive and hope to eventually start my own business or even multiple ventures, leveraging the skills I’ve gained throughout my education and personal experiences. This class is particularly important to me as I aim to sharpen my front-end coding skills, which will be essential in both my professional and entrepreneurial pursuits.

            Beyond my academic and career ambitions, music has always played a central role in my life. From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the power of music to evoke emotions and tell stories, leading me to explore various instruments, particularly the guitar and piano. These instruments have become extensions of my identity, and I’ve dedicated countless hours to mastering them, not just as a hobby but as a form of personal expression. In addition to music, I’m deeply committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, with exercise being a vital part of my daily routine. Staying fit and active helps me stay focused and energized, which is crucial given my busy schedule. When I’m not engaged in music or fitness, I love to travel and go on adventures, having explored numerous countries across Asia, Europe, and the USA. These experiences have broadened my horizons, fueling my passion for discovery and my desire to keep exploring new places whenever I can.
