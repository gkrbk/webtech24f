            <p class="legends-header-text">As a huge fan of LeBron James, I've always been fascinated by what other NBA legends have to say about him. It's one thing for fans to call him the GOAT, but when legends who've built the game start praising his skills, impact, and influence—it takes that conversation to another level. Watching these videos, where some of basketball's greatest players talk about LeBron, you can really feel the respect they have for what he's achieved and how he's changed the game. These insights from legends who know the grind and understand the game on a deeper level make me appreciate LeBron's journey even more. Their words solidify why he's held up as one of the all-time greats, and why his legacy will keep inspiring future generations.</p>
