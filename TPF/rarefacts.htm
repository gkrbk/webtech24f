            <h2>LeBron’s Unbreakable Streak of Double-Digit Scoring</h2>
            <img width="600" src="lebronscoringstreak.jpg" alt="Lebron scoring streak graphic" title="Lebron Scoring Streak">
            <p>LeBron James has one of the craziest records in NBA history—a streak of scoring in double digits every single game that’s lasted for over a decade. This streak started all the way back in 2007, and he’s still going strong, making it the longest ever in the NBA. The consistency he shows is just incredible. Even when he’s having an off night or facing tough defenses, LeBron always manages to put up at least 10 points. It really shows how relentless and adaptable he is, no matter the circumstances.</p>
            <p>To me, this streak represents more than just a number—it's proof of LeBron's unmatched resilience. Night after night, season after season, he has delivered when his team needed him. Personally, it reminds me of how important showing up every day is, even when conditions aren't perfect. LeBron is the embodiment of “consistency beats intensity,” and I think that’s something that is really really impressive</p>

            <h2>LeBron’s Game-Winning Buzzer-Beaters</h2>
            <img width="600" src="lebrongamewinning.jpg" alt="Lebron Buzzer Beater" title="Lebron Game Winning Shot">
            <p>LeBron James has hit more game-winning buzzer-beaters in the playoffs than anyone in NBA history. Time and time again, he’s risen to the occasion in those clutch moments—moments where everything is on the line and the whole world is watching. Whether it was his incredible off-balance three-pointer against the Orlando Magic in 2009 or his fadeaway jumper over the Pacers in 2018, LeBron’s ability to stay calm and deliver under pressure is truly next-level. He’s shown that he’s not just a superstar during regular games; when the pressure is at its peak, that’s when he’s at his best.</p>
            <p>To me, these game-winning shots just show how clutch LeBron really is. He steps up when most players would crack under pressure, and that’s what makes him one of the best. Honestly, watching LeBron hit those shots makes you believe anything's possible if you just stay cool and trust yourself when it counts.</p>
